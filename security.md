IBM Maximo Application Suite Dedicated Service personnel who are granted O/S or console level access to customer servers are required to use multi-factor authentication. Unique 2048-bit ssh keys are issued to each IBM user in order to connect to the IBM Cloud VPN. Phone based authentication via PIN is also required each time an IBMer connects. These factoring mechanisms are maintained, managed and issued by IBM Cloud Security and the IBM Maximo Application Suite Dedicated Environment Operations Manager.

IBM's internal network prevents employees from accessing malicious websites using Symantec Bluecoat and ProofPoint Targeted Attack Protection (TAP).

IBM Maximo Application Suite Dedicated Service personal access credentials are role based and managed using an IBM internal access management system.

Access is based by job duties (least privilege principal) in accordance with IBM IT Security Policy. The IBM SRE security team performs the following processes to ensure only those individuals who require access to systems have it, and to ensure the right privileges are in place.

Every quarter, a separation of duties review is performed by the IBM Maximo Application Suite Dedicated Service management team to ensure no one individual has a conflict of roles without adequate safeguards beings in place.

Every quarter, a review of user access is performed to ensure existing users and privileges are still required.

A defined process is in place to ensure individuals who leave the IBM SRE team, even if to other areas within IBM, have their UserID and privileges revoked.

The IBM Maximo Application Suite Dedicated team performs proactive management and deployment of patches, updates and fixes to the Application, Middleware, Database and O/S layers via a planned Maintenance & Outage Calendar

IBM SRE team employs a defense in depth strategy (DiD) for boundary protection that includes firewalls and encrypted communications for remote connectivity to access the environment.  All communications that cross this boundary are controlled and monitored.

The IBM Cloud network ports are protected with firewalls, which serve as intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention (IPS) agents. Details regarding on IBM Cloud intrusion detection management is IBM Confidential information and covered under IBM Cloud SOC2 compliance (see compliance section below).
