The IBM MAS Client Communication Center (CCC) portal is the primary communication channel for environment alerts, incidents, maintenance, security and announcement notices for all MAS-Dedicated customer environments.

It is important that all customers designate members of their staff to log in to the CCC portal and subscribe to email notifications in order to receive important information and notice of upcoming maintenance regarding their environment(s).
