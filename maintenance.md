## 2022 Maintenance Windows
{: #2021-maintenance-windows}

Maintenance Windows generally apply to production environments only.

Standard maintenance times are planned twice monthly, in a 6 hour window from 21:00 to 03:00 UTC Saturday / Sunday. 

The IBM Maximo Application Suite Managed Services team may choose to use all, some, or none of the planned maintenance windows and will proactively notify customers 5-10 days prior to any outage that will be taken.

Systems are not available to users during maintenance windows.

Non-Production systems may be scheduled for maintenance during the week, 1- 2 weeks prior to planned maintenance on Production systems to allow additional time for testing.

Change Freeze period for year end 2022 is December 17, 2022 through January 2, 2023
Systems are available to users and all standard automated processes such as database backups continue as normal during the change freeze period.  Coordinated changes to environments like application upgrades as an example are not available during this time.  The IBM Maximo Application Suite Managed Services team also does not schedule any maintenance during the change freeze period. 

## Upgrade Policy

Application and MAS component Upgrades are on a defined schedule based on the Maximo Application Suite release schedule and complexity of the upgrade.  It is expected customers will be upgraded to the current version within 6 months of release.  Upgrades will be deployed first to test and then scheduled for production.  The test window length will depend on the size and complexity of the change and will be communicated through the Customer Communications Center as soon as it is available.

## Emergency Maintenance
