# Self-Service Portal
{: #ssp}

![SSP-Main-Page](images/SSP-Main-Page.png "SSP-Main-Page"){: caption=""}

Self Service Portal URL: https://devops.maximo.com

The purpose of the Self-Service Portal is to empower our clients to access and execute selected services in both production and non-production environments. These pre-selected tasks can be run immediately or scheduled for a future time.

The Self Service Portal should be used in lieu of submitting a support case. Before submitting a case, check to see if your issue can be addressed by using the SSP. If a case/ticket is submitted to execute a request that is available on the Self Service Portal, the case will be rejected and closed. Customers can open a case if their job fails in the Self Service Portal. Be sure to include detail of failed job in the case. Please note as more features are added to Self Service Portal, the expectation is that customers will use this functionality in lieu of submitting individual support cases.

The Self-Service Portal is comprised of two main parts, the Access Management Tool for administering Access Requests, and the Self-Service Automation for submitting Service Requests to run against assets.

This portal is available to all IBM Maximo Application Suite – Managed Service, IBM Maximo Application Suite – Dedicated and IBM Maximo Application Suite - SaaS Customers.

You must have access to the Access Management tool in the Self-Service Portal before obtaining access to Self-Service Automation. If you do not have access to the Access Management tool please see [Obtaining Access to the Access Management Tool](#obtaining-access-to-am-tool).

#### Start Asset Management Application
{: #start-asset-management-application}

This task can be used to start the IBM Maximo Manage application for the target environment.

To execute this task on an environment, follow the instructions for [Submitting a Service Request](#submitting-requests).

#### Stop Asset Management Application
{: #stop-asset-management-application}

This task can be used to stop the IBM Maximo Manage application for the target environment.

To execute this task on an environment, follow the instructions for [Submitting a Service Request](#submitting-requests).

#### Restart Asset Management Application
{: #restart-asset-management-application}

This task can be used to restart the IBM Maximo Manage application for the target environment.

To execute this task on an environment, follow the instructions for [Submitting a Service Request](#submitting-requests).

#### Run ConfigDB
{: #run-configdb}

This task can be used to apply all pending database configuration changes for the target environment. The task stops the IBM Maximo Manage application, runs the Maximo ConfigDB process, then restarts the IBM Maximo Manage application.

To execute this task on an environment, follow the instructions for [Submitting a Service Request](#submitting-requests), and check the box to certify that a recent backup has been taken in Step 5.

   ![SSP-ConfigDB](images/SSP-ConfigDB-panel.png "SSP-ConfigDB"){: caption=""}

This task could take several hours to complete depending on the types of changes being made and how much data resides in the database tables being modified. Additionally, access to the database will be limited during the execution of this task to users belonging to restricted access groups.
{: attention}

##### Database Restore When ConfigDB Fails
{: #when-configdb-fails}

- For scenarios where there is a ConfigDB failure, automation restores the database to a timestamp previous to the start of the ConfigDB process.
- Depending on the backup history for this database, this process can be very time consuming.


#### Run REORG and RUNSTATS
{: #run-reorg-and-runstats}

To execute this task on an environment, follow the instructions for [Submitting a Service Request](#submitting-requests), and select one of the following options from the drop down list in Step 5.

   ![SSP-Reorg](images/SSP-Reorg-Chooser.png "SSP-Reorg"){: caption=""}

`Runstats only` operation to improve SQL performance. This option updates statistics in the system catalog about tables, view, and indexes. DB2’s query optimizer uses these statistics to improve query performance.

`Online reorganization` of tablespaces along with runstats operation for the target asset to improve SQL performance and reclaim fragmented disk space. The environment is not stopped for this option.

Most cases require only the Runstats operation. Reorganization of tablespaces need only be run if a significant amount of data has been deleted from the database since the last tablespace reorganization.
{: note}

#### Run MAS MustGather and upload to ECuRep
{: #run-mas-mustgather}

This task will collect application logs from the target environment and upload the logs to the ECuRep (IBM Support) server.

To execute this task on an environment, follow the instructions for [Submitting a Service Request](#submitting-requests), and fill-in the `Support Case ID` in Step 5.

   ![SSP-MustGather](images/SSP-MustGather-panel.png "SSP-MustGather"){: caption=""}

## How to Grant an Existing User Access to a Customer
{: #grant-user-access-customer-am-tool}

If your user role is Manager follow these steps to make an existing user a Manager for your Customer.

Only users that will be responsible for approving/rejecting access requests should be assigned the Manager role.
{: note}

1. Sign into the Self-Service Portal: https://devops.maximo.com

2. Navigate to the Access Management application.

    ![SSP-AM-Grant-User-Customer-1](images/SSP-AM-Grant-User-Customer-1.png "SSP-AM-Grant-User-Customer-1"){: caption=""}

3. If the user does not have access to your Customer, follow the instructions for [How to Grant a User Access to a Customer](#how-to-grant-a-user-access-to-a-customer)

4. Once the user has access to your Customer if they are a STD_USER then all you need to do is open their access record and change the Role on the Person Information page to MANAGER. This will automatically assign them as a Manager for your customer.

5. If the user is already a Manager for another Customer then you must first change their Role to STD_USER. You can then change it to MANAGER. This will automatically assign them as a Manager for your customer.



Managers in the Access Management application are able to grant existing users access to the customer they are managing. This process is similar to adding a new user to the Access Management tool. Once a user is granted access to a customer they can submit access requests for that customer. All access requests must be approved by a Manager User for that customer before they are granted.

Follow these steps to grant a user access to the customer you are assigned to manage.

1. Sign into the Self-Service Portal: https://devops.maximo.com

2. Navigate to the Access Management tool.

    If a question mark icon does not pop up in the IBMid field, the user does not exist yet. Follow the steps in the [How to Create a New User](#create-new-user-am-tool) document to create the new user. The process of creating a new user will also grant the user access to the customer you are managing.
